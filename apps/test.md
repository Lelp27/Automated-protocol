# How to use
***This method is optimized for `cloning` with `OT-2`.***  
(PCR - Assembly - Transformation)

- The Maximum number of plates is 5
- Using OT-2 the reaction plate should be One on thermocycler
- **If name of sample is empty, the sample will be skipped**

1. Fill the `Sample Plate` in the order of the following table

2. Describe the Reaction using Sample you write in `Sample Plate`

3. Fill the `TF plate` in the order of the following table.
   - You can spot the same sample several times

4. Click `Make Protocol` button.
   - Automatically check the error. 
     - same sample name, no sample name ...
   - The Report will be displayed
     - Transformed Plate on each sample is recorded
     - Parameters used in this protocol
   - Download and Transfer `protocol.py` file to OT-2
   - Run the protocol with appropriate samples
