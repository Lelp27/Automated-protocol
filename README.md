# Protocols  

## Verified Protocols

* Every Protocol have own Setup Process and Programs refer to each README.md    
  

**Nanopore** : For construction of nanopore sequencing library (Ligation Sequencing Kit)  

**well_pooling.py** : Pool every wells from 96 well plate.  

**Tag_dispense** : Dispense the Tagging Primer according to column and row.   

**DNAssembler** : **Use Streamlit** DNA part assembly, golden gate assembly, DNA library generation (Refer to Own repository)

# Streamlit Usage

* The Docker containers are getting ready.

## In preparation

**Plate_replication** : Replicate 96-well plate according to specified column and row.
